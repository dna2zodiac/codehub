// Package lzw implements the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed data format,
// described in T. A. Welch, ``A Technique for High-Performance Data
// Compression'', Computer, 17(6) (June 1984), pp 8-19.
//
// In particular, it implements LZW as used by the GIF and PDF file
// formats, which means variable-width codes up to 12 bits and the first
// two non-literal codes are a clear code and an EOF code.
//
// The TIFF file format uses a similar but incompatible version of the LZW
// algorithm. See the golang.org/x/image/tiff/lzw package for an
// implementation.
package lzw // compress/lze

// TODO(nigeltao): check that PDF uses LZW in the same way as GIF,
// modulo LSB/MSB packing order.

	"errors"
	"io"

// NewReader creates a new io.ReadCloser.
// Reads from the returned io.ReadCloser read and decompress data from r.
// If r does not also implement io.ByteReader,
// the decompressor may read more data than necessary from r.
// It is the caller's responsibility to call Close on the ReadCloser when
// finished reading.
// The number of bits to use for literal codes, litWidth, must be in the
// range [2,8] and is typically 8. It must equal the litWidth
// used during compression.

// NewWriter creates a new io.WriteCloser.
// Writes to the returned io.WriteCloser are compressed and written to w.
// It is the caller's responsibility to call Close on the WriteCloser when
// finished writing.

// range [2,8] and is typically 8. Input bytes must be less than 1<<litWidth.
