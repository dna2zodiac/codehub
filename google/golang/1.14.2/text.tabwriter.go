// Package tabwriter implements a write filter (tabwriter.Writer) that
// translates tabbed columns in input into properly aligned text.
//
// The package is using the Elastic Tabstops algorithm described at
// http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/index.html.
//
// The text/tabwriter package is frozen and is not accepting new features.

// A Writer is a filter that inserts padding around tab-delimited
// columns in its input to align them in the output.
//
// The Writer treats incoming bytes as UTF-8-encoded text consisting
// of cells terminated by horizontal ('\t') or vertical ('\v') tabs,
// and newline ('\n') or formfeed ('\f') characters; both newline and
// formfeed act as line breaks.
//
// Tab-terminated cells in contiguous lines constitute a column. The
// Writer inserts padding as needed to make all cells in a column have
// the same width, effectively aligning the columns. It assumes that
// all characters have the same width, except for tabs for which a
// tabwidth must be specified. Column cells must be tab-terminated, not
// tab-separated: non-tab terminated trailing text at the end of a line
// forms a cell but that cell is not part of an aligned column.
// For instance, in this example (where | stands for a horizontal tab):
//
//	aaaa|bbb|d
//	aa  |b  |dd
//	a   |
//	aa  |cccc|eee
//
// the b and c are in distinct columns (the b column is not contiguous
// all the way). The d and e are not in a column at all (there's no
// terminating tab, nor would the column be contiguous).
//
// The Writer assumes that all Unicode code points have the same width;
// this may not be true in some fonts or if the string contains combining
// characters.
//
// If DiscardEmptyColumns is set, empty columns that are terminated
// entirely by vertical (or "soft") tabs are discarded. Columns
// terminated by horizontal (or "hard") tabs are not affected by
// this flag.
//
// If a Writer is configured to filter HTML, HTML tags and entities
// are passed through. The widths of tags and entities are
// assumed to be zero (tags) and one (entities) for formatting purposes.
//
// A segment of text may be escaped by bracketing it with Escape
// characters. The tabwriter passes escaped text segments through
// unchanged. In particular, it does not interpret any tabs or line
// breaks within the segment. If the StripEscape flag is set, the
// Escape characters are stripped from the output; otherwise they
// are passed through as well. For the purpose of formatting, the
// width of the escaped text is always computed excluding the Escape
// characters.
//
// The formfeed character acts like a newline but it also terminates
// all columns in the current line (effectively calling Flush). Tab-
// terminated cells in the next line start new columns. Unless found
// inside an HTML tag or inside an escaped text segment, formfeed
// characters appear as newlines in the output.
//
// The Writer must buffer input internally, because proper spacing
// of one line may depend on the cells in future lines. Clients must
// call Flush when done calling Write.

// Internal representation (current state):
//
// - all text written is appended to buf; tabs and line breaks are stripped away
// - at any given time there is a (possibly empty) incomplete cell at the end
//   (the cell starts after a tab or line break)
// - cell.size is the number of bytes belonging to the cell so far
// - cell.width is text width in runes of that cell from the start of the cell to
//   position pos; html tags and entities are excluded from this width if html
//   filtering is enabled
// - the sizes and widths of processed text are kept in the lines list
//   which contains a list of cells for each line
// - the widths list is a temporary list with current widths used during
//   formatting; it is kept in Writer because it's re-used
//
