// An example of good use of a Pool is in the fmt package, which maintains a
// dynamically-sized store of temporary output buffers. The store scales under
// load (when many goroutines are actively printing) and shrinks when
// quiescent.
//
// On the other hand, a free list maintained as part of a short-lived object is
// not a suitable use for a Pool, since the overhead does not amortize well in
// that scenario. It is more efficient to have such objects implement their own
